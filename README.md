# Clustering-Crypto
This challenge required taking what I have learned about unsupervised learning and the AWS services and apply it to new situations. For this project, I needed to generate a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification. I used my unsupervised learning and Amazon SageMaker skills to cluster cryptocurrencies and create plots to present my results. As you will see on both crypto clustering.ipynb and crypto clustering-sm.ipynb, I have produced plots, a table of tradable cryptocurrencies and printed the total number of tradable cryptocurrencies as well by clustering the cryptocurrencies and using K-Means prediction model. It was challenging and very interesting with regard to using new acquired skills.
